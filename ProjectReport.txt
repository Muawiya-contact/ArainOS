Phase 1 – Project Setup & Initial Folder Structure
Objective:
Set up the initial repository and project structure for ArainOS, ensuring a modular and maintainable layout that supports future expansion (kernel, drivers, user apps, GUI, etc.) and prepares for building in virtual machines.
Tasks Completed:
1.	Created the main repository: OS/.
2.	Added essential top-level files:
o	README.md → project overview and setup instructions
o	ProjectReport.pdf → this report documenting progress
3.	Designed initial folder hierarchy inside `OS/`:
```
OS/
├── include/           # Global header files (kernel, arch, user ABI)
├── boot/              # BIOS/UEFI bootloader code
├── kernel/            # Kernel source (core, sched, syscall)
├── arch/              # Architecture-specific code (x86_64)
├── mm/                # Memory management modules
├── drivers/           # Device drivers (pci, input, display)
├── fs/                # Filesystem modules
├── net/               # Networking modules
├── libk/              # Kernel library
├── user/              # Userland programs & libc
├── gui/               # GUI / compositor
├── tools/             # Build and utility tools
├── scripts/           # Build / run / packaging scripts
├── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
├── build/             # Out-of-tree build outputs
├── iso/               # Final ISO images for VM
├── config/            # Build-time config & feature toggles
└── doc/               # Documentation (BUILD.md, DESIGN.md)

```
Key Decisions & Rationale:

•	include/ is the single source of truth for all headers.
•	kernel and user code are strictly separated to maintain clean user/kernel boundaries.
•	Prepared structure to easily integrate syscalls, drivers, GUI, filesystem, and networking in future phases.
•	Out-of-tree build/ keeps repository clean and simplifies cross-architecture builds.
•	Scripts are placed in scripts/ to allow both Linux and Windows (PowerShell) builds.
Outcome:
•	Phase 1 establishes the foundation of ArainOS.
•	Project hierarchy ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability for all remaining phases.
